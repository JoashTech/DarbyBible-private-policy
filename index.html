This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Processing Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Services</strong>: Our app uses advertising networks (Google AdMob, Unity Ads, Vungle/Liftoff) to display ads. These networks may collect anonymized device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address (for country-level targeting), device type, and ad interaction data. No app content (e.g., notes, highlights, shared images) or SMS is accessed. See their privacy policies:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob's Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Ads Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Privacy Policy</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Services</strong>: Firebase Analytics may collect anonymized app usage data (e.g., screen views, button clicks, session duration) and device basics. No personal details or app content (e.g., quiz answers, notes) are collected, as outlined in <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Reporting Services</strong>: Firebase Crashlytics may collect anonymized crash reports (e.g., stack traces, device model, OS version) to improve stability. No user content or personal data is included, per <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: Notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, highlights, and customizations are stored locally on your device using Room persistence. This data is fully offline, not transmitted to our servers, and deleted upon app uninstall.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: If enabled in the App's settings, we use device permissions to schedule daily verse/prayer reminders at 08:00 and 20:00. No content is tracked.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Initiated Actions</strong>: Shares of verses (e.g., images to social media, gallery, or SMS) are handled by your device's sharing system and not collected or tracked by the App.</li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information</strong>: We do not collect names, emails, exact locations, photos, files, or SMS unless you voluntarily provide them (e.g., via email contact).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Data Is Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: Ad networks use anonymized data to serve relevant ads and measure performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: Analytics services use data to help us understand user interactions and enhance App features.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Reporting</strong>: Crash reporting services use data to identify and fix crashes for improved stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: Notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, and customizations provide personalized features within the App, stored offline.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Device permissions deliver user-configured daily reminders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share local data, user content (e.g., notes, highlights, shared images), notification preferences, or device files with third parties. Our advertising and analytics partners may collect and process anonymized data independently:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: May share anonymized device identifiers and ad interactions with ad partners (<a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Unity Ads</strong>: Processes data for ad serving and analytics (<a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Vungle (Liftoff)</strong>: Uses data for ad targeting and measurement (<a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics</strong>: Shares anonymized usage and crash data with Google (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy</a>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the following options regarding your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Opt out of personalized ads by resetting your Advertising ID or disabling personalized ads in your device's settings (e.g., Android Settings > Google > Ads).</li>
        <li>Manage data collection through our partners' privacy controls or adjust your device's settings.</li>
        <li>Disable notifications in the App's settings or your device's notification settings.</li>
        <li>Delete local data by clearing the App's data through your device's settings or uninstalling the App.</li>
        <li>Manage user-initiated shares through your device's sharing permissions.</li>
        <li>Review and manage preferences through our partners' policies:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob Controls</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Privacy Controls</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Privacy Controls</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Local data (notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, highlights, customizations) is retained on your device until you clear the App's data or uninstall it. We do not store personal data on our servers. Third-party data is retained per their policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Data Retention</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Data Retention</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Data Retention</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is rated E for Everyone and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Mobile Application. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to help us enforce this policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Mobile Application. If we become aware of such data, we will delete it immediately. Please contact us if you have concerns.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on Android's built-in security features, such as app sandboxing, to protect local data stored on your device. Since no data is transmitted to our servers, there is no risk of server-side data breaches. Our third-party partners implement their own security measures as described in their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>8. International Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Union (GDPR) or California (CCPA), you may have additional rights, such as requesting data access or deletion. Since we only store data locally and use third-party services for ads and analytics, you can exercise these rights through your device settings or our partners' privacy controls. Contact us for assistance with data subject requests.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app uses the following third-party services that may collect anonymized data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> - Advertising network</li>
        <li><strong>Unity Ads</strong> - Advertising network</li>
        <li><strong>Vungle (Liftoff)</strong> - Advertising network</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> - Usage analytics</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> - Crash reporting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each service operates under its own privacy policy, and we encourage you to review them.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or third-party services. We will post the updated policy on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date, and your continued use of the App constitutes consent to those changes.</p>
